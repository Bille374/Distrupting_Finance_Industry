# Building Ethereum Compatible blockchain to Implement a business logic

As ay Smart Contract Developer My task is to Create speed to Automatize System Execution Of Transaction by building  a Blockchain to connect with financial institutions

Smart Contracts can read and write data in Blockchain, they are Automatic, fast, direct, cheap and Transparent wihout any human errors.

In our case of study is creation of Joint Bank Accounts privided two addresses to send and withdraw funds by writing a smart contract use Ether to provide the feature of joint saving accounts.

# Implementation By Using JVM

Smart Contract Compilation: The solidity source code .sol file is executed by solidity compiler and the compiler spits out the EVM bytecode that is deployed to main or testnet and the contract abstract Binary Interface

The source code .sol file basically it's a raw data consists on declaring State variables the twos payable addresses and the amount of deposit, withdraw the funds
Also the use of the constructor helps to make reading code easily and save gas the time of deployment the contract

At the end creating a callback function called  external payable funds the accounts to get any ether from outside world

# Conclusion 

Smart Contract is the future of our broken finantial system control by one centralized bank keep making same mistakes over and over,
In contrast Simple business idea gets translated to code can fix the issue we have.
